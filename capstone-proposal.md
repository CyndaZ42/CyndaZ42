## Name of Student:

## Name of Project:
My Portfolio (Working Title)
## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
Make me look cool I guess
## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
A webpage
## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
I plan to use JavaScript and HTML, and I may convert it into react later.
there will also be a simpler version incorporated into the readme, so it will be displayed on my Github profile.
## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
I plan to add in extra fun to my website by adding in tools games brought over from older projects to showcase my work in action.
## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
IDK yet.
## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
Because the readme is a large part of the project, the research and planning log will be in a different file:
[research-planning-log.md](/research-planning-log.md)
